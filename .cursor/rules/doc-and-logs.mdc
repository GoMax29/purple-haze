- All external APIs (e.g., weather, swell) must be documented in `docs/Documentation.md`:

  - endpoint structure
  - used parameters
  - example request/response

- Any custom algorithm (e.g., Gaussian, swell/precip weighting) must be documented in markdown.

- Update `docs/Project.md` with:

  - milestones
  - current task
  - TODO / IN PROGRESS / DONE list

- Maintain a local `this.log` file for runtime debugging output (pasted by the user when needed).

- Maintain a `docs/index.json` file (grep-based) to quickly reference existing markdown content.
